# DragX
Extended Drag n Drop Library in Javascript
I couldn't find a javascript drag and drop library which is capable of auto scrolling. So I made my own. I will update things when I get time. I am bad at explaining things. Please forgive me.
<br>
View a <a href="https://joshyfrancis.github.io/DragX/DragXTest.htm" target="_blank">Demo</a> and try to drag elements. See the inner scrolling of elements.
# Features
  1. Mobile friendly
  2. Autoscrolling
  3. No external dependency
  4. Cross browser ( IE9+)
